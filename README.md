# IotGarageOpener
ESP8266 Based WiFi Garage Opener

## Getting Started

This project has been tested using the NodeMCU 1.0 ESP8266 board.  All of the code has been developed using Visual Studio Code with the Arduino extension.  The uploading of the data folder though still needs to be done with the Arduino IDE after installing the ESP8266FS plugin and the esptools.py.
